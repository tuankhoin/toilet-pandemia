## Game Explanation and Gameplay
### **Game Explanation**

Our game is a first person shooter (FPS), based in a post-apocalyptic world where COVID-19 has ravaged the world's population. You assume the role of an average manager, intent on locating and distributing the vaccine to finally put an end to the pandemic. However this vaccine is held in a nearby shopping center, defended by a horde of Karens who want nothing more than to see the world burn, having succumbed to the frustrations of state-enforced lockdown long ago. 

Your objective, to enter the shopping center, and collect critical supplies for the residents in your community, all the while doing the following:

1. Avoiding incineration at the hands of the Karens' powerful fire attacks
2. Maintaining an appropriate 1.5m social distance, or else risk contracting COVID-19 from the Karens themselves
3. Surviving long enough to discover the super vaccine, and taking it when it appears

Points are accrued for gathering supplies, defeating Karens, and surviving levels. Health packs will also randomly spawn, that will allow the player to recover any lost health. The game takes on a classic arcade 'survival' format, that is, the player plays until he/she finally falls to the Karen hordes, an inevitability since each level rises in difficulty to eventually impossible scenarios.

## Modelling Objects and Entities

### Object Pooling

In order to maintain efficiency for CPU and avoid continuous calls of `Instanstiate()` and `Destroy()`, an object pool is created in order to keep game objects reusable. The common mechanisim goes as follows (based on [pooling tutorial by Mark Placzek](https://www.raywenderlich.com/847-object-pooling-in-unity) ):

* A pool of chosen data structure (in this project: `List`) type is created to store objects of a specified number.
```C#
    // How a pooled object's information are stored - ObjectPool.cs
    [System.Serializable] public class ObjectPoolItem {
        public string name;                 // Object name
        public GameObject objectToPool;     // Prefab of object
        public float amountToPoolEachLevel; // How many to expand each level
        public bool shouldExpand;           // Indicates no limit in capacity
    }

    public List<ObjectPoolItem> itemsToPool;    // Information storage
    public List<GameObject> pooledObjects;      // Object pool data structure
```

```C#
// How a pool is initiated - ObjectPool.cs

pooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();
foreach (ObjectPoolItem item in itemsToPool) {
    // Initialize the number of items required for the current level
    for (int i = 0; i < Mathf.FloorToInt(item.amountToPoolEachLevel * Player.SharedInstance.level); i++) {
        
        GameObject obj = (GameObject)Instantiate(item.objectToPool);

        // Only hide fireball, the rest appears with new level
        if (item.objectToPool.tag == "Fireball") obj.SetActive(false);
        else obj.SetActive(true);
        
        // Add to storage pool as well
        pooledObjects.Add(obj);
    }
}
```

* Every time in need, instead of calling `Instanstiate`, system will choose an inactive item in the pool data structure and activate it.
```C#
// How objects are retrieved on new level rather than Instanstiating - Player.cs 
void SpawnNewLevel() {

    // Look through each pool of item
    foreach (ObjectPoolItem item in ObjectPooler.SharedInstance.itemsToPool) {
        string tag = item.objectToPool.tag;

        // Fireball is only stored for boss karens only, not with levels
        if (tag == "Fireball") continue;

        // Pick items with needed quantity (by level), and set to be active in map
        for (int i = 0; i < Mathf.FloorToInt(item.amountToPoolEachLevel * level); i++) {
            GameObject obj = ObjectPooler.SharedInstance.GetPooledObject(tag);
            if (obj != null) {
                // Allocate a spawn position, and spawn object from there
                obj.GetComponent<randomSpawn>().SetPosition();
                obj.SetActive(true);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* In case of no available object in the pool left, system can either stop if there is a capacity limit, or `Instanstiate` another available object to put to list and later used in the future.
```C#
// How an object is retrieved from the pool - ObjectPool.cs

// Returns an object from the pool to be activated
public GameObject GetPooledObject(string tag) {
    // Search in the pool to see if there is any available object left
    for (int i = 0; i < pooledObjects.Count; i++) {
        if (!pooledObjects[i].activeInHierarchy && pooledObjects[i].tag == tag) 
        return pooledObjects[i];
    }

    // If there is none available left, just make a new one
    foreach (ObjectPoolItem item in itemsToPool) {
        if (item.objectToPool.tag == tag) {
            // Note: If there is limited capacity requirement, 
            // then skip this process and return null
            if (item.shouldExpand) {
                GameObject obj = (GameObject)Instantiate(item.objectToPool);
                obj.SetActive(true);
                pooledObjects.Add(obj);
                return obj;
            }
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```
* When ending functionality, rather than `Destroy`, system will deactivate the object ( `GameObject.SetActive(false)` ) and put it back to the data structure for later usage.

Currently in the game, the object pool is being used on the following objects that will require the most amount of `Instanstiate` if not using pool:
* Karens
* Bonus items
* Fireball shot by Karens

### Karen Control

As the main enemy, Karens in the game has the objective to chase and infect the player.

#### **Following Player**
When the player is detected to be in sight, depending on the type of Karen, it will either follow, or aim at player
```C#
// Check if player and karen are close to each other on the same elevation - EnemyFollowing.cs

float d // Euclidean distance
= Vector3.Distance(followingPlayer.transform.position, transform.position); 

float deltaHeight // Height difference, to avoid detection between different floors
= Mathf.Abs(transform.position.y-followingPlayer.transform.position.y); 

// If in sight...
if (d < distance && deltaHeight < minimumHeightDifference) {
    // Follow or aim at player
    transform.LookAt(followingPlayer.transform.position);
    ...
}
```

#### **Close-Range Infection**
Of course, if the player do not keep social distancing, then health will decrease by time.
```C#
// Called every update to see if social distancing is maintained. If not, drain health - Player.cs
void Distance()
{
    // Check each enemy...
    for (int i = 0; i < targets.Length; i++){
            // ... to see how far they are from player
        float distance = Vector3.Distance(targets[i].transform.position, transform.position);
            // If social distancing is broken, then reduce health
        if (distance < distanceMinimum)
        {
            ... // Decrease health
        }
    }

}
```

#### **Shooting Fireballs**

If a Karen is capable of shooting fireballs, it will do so when player is in sight.
```C#
// Shooting fireballs on sight - BossBehavior.cs

// If in sight...
if (d < distance && deltaHeight < 5) {
    CheckIfTimeToFire();    // Shoot fireballs
}
```

As mentioned, at a constant rate, fireballs will be taken from the object pool rather than being instanstiated. It will either explodes on collision with player, or vanish after a while in the air.
```C#
// Shoot fireball after a specified period of time - BossBehavior.cs
public void CheckIfTimeToFire()
{
    // When specified shooting time is reached
    if(Time.time > nextFire)
    {
        // Initiate a fireball from pool
        GameObject obj = ObjectPooler.SharedInstance.GetPooledObject("Fireball");
        if (obj != null) {
            obj.transform.position = transform.position;
            obj.transform.rotation = Quaternion.identity;
            obj.SetActive(true);

            // Set fireball to aim at player
            FireBallBehavior fb = obj.GetComponent<FireBallBehavior>();
            fb.Initiate();
        }

        nextFire = Time.time + fireRate; // Set timer for the next fire
    }
} 

// How a fireball can disappear - FireBallBehavior.cs
void Update () {
    // Fireball has limited lifetime
    if (Time.time - startTime > existTime) gameObject.SetActive(false);
}
void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {
    // If collides with player...
    if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Player")) ... ; // Explode and decrease health
}
```

### Level Switching & Vaccine

```C#
// Implementation between levels - Player.cs

// In case of just finished a level...
if (targets.Length==0 && !isCountDown) {
	
	...// Set vaccine to be available

	// Start count down until next level
	startTime = Time.time;
	isCountDown = true;
	timeLeft = levelRelaxTime + startTime - Time.time;
} 

// In case of being in count down: update time left
else if (isCountDown) {
	timeLeft = levelRelaxTime + startTime - Time.time;
	
	// If time's up
	if (timeLeft < 0) {
		
		...// Holy Vaccine disappears
		
		// Generate new level
		level++;
		isCountDown = false;
		SpawnNewLevel();
		targets = GameObject.FindObjectsOfType<EnemyBehavior>();
	}
}
```

## Graphics and Camera

## Shaders and Particles

```
Descriptions of how the shaders work must be clearly detailed in the
report. It should be made clear how the use of a shader provides a
benefit over an equivalent CPU based approach, if applicable.
```

Evaluate on this very carefully guys! They mostly care abt this and evaluation!
* How shader works (and show which variables does what)
* How it is efficient to CPU

### Outline Shader

### Half-tone Shader

### Additive Blending for Particles

## Evaluation Techniques

As part of the development of this game, two evaluation techniques were utilized to gather feedback from five external participants and improve the game. One querying method, 'cooperative evaluation', and one observational method, 'questionnaire', made up these two techniques.

We felt that these two techniques were very synergistic, since cooperative evaluation involves an ongoing dialogue during gameplay, effectively capturing player thoughts during a playthrough, and a questionnaire is completed after gameplay, after the player has had ample chance to reflect. This meant that we would gather useful insights at all stages of the player experience. Both were also practical given the current climate, since both had zero requirements for face-to-face contact.

For cooperative evaluation, the test user entered a 1-on-1 Zoom call with a member of the team, and would share their screen. During gameplay, the test user was invited to share any thoughts they had when playing the game, with emphasis on zero judgement for any comments made, which encouraged an open dialogue between the team member and test user. When the user was silent, the user was left to their own device.

For the questionnaire, the test user was given a link to an online questionnaire roughly 10-15 minutes after completion of the game. See below for a link to the questionnaire:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2ZJDMKM

The intent of this questionnaire was to uncover any core gameplay issues that users felt detracted from the quality of the game, and also prompted for any new features the user would like to see.
