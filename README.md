## Game Explanation and Gameplay
**Game Explanation**

Our game is a first person shooter (FPS), based in a post-apocalyptic world where COVID-19 has ravaged the world's population. You assume the role of an average citizen, intent on locating and distributing the vaccine to finally put an end to the pandemic. However this vaccine is held in a nearby shopping center, defended by a horde of Karens who want nothing more than to see the world burn, having succumbed to the frustrations of state-enforced lockdown long ago. 

Your objective, to enter the shopping center, and collect critical supplies for the residents in your community, all the while doing the following:

1. Avoiding incineration at the hands of the Karens' powerful fire attacks
2. Maintaining an appropriate 1.5m social distance, or else risk contracting COVID-19 from the Karens themselves
3. Surviving long enough to discover the super vaccine, and taking it when it appears

Points are accrued for gathering supplies, defeating Karens, and surviving levels. Health packs will also randomly spawn, that will allow the player to recover any lost health. The game takes on a classic arcade 'survival' format, that is, the player plays until he/she finally falls to the Karen hordes, an inevitability since each level rises in difficulty to eventually impossible scenarios.

## Evaluation Techniques

As part of the development of this game, two evaluation techniques were utilized to gather feedback from five external participants and improve the game. One querying method, 'cooperative evaluation', and one observational method, 'questionnaire', made up these two techniques.

We felt that these two techniques were very synergistic, since cooperative evaluation involves an ongoing dialogue during gameplay, effectively capturing player thoughts during a playthrough, and a questionnaire is completed after gameplay, after the player has had ample chance to reflect. This meant that we would gather useful insights at all stages of the player experience. Both were also practical given the current climate, since both had zero requirements for face-to-face contact.

For cooperative evaluation, the test user entered a 1-on-1 Zoom call with a member of the team, and would share their screen. During gameplay, the test user was invited to share any thoughts they had when playing the game, with emphasis on zero judgement for any comments made, which encouraged an open dialogue between the team member and test user. When the user was silent, the user was left to their own device.

For the questionnaire, the test user was given a link to an online questionnaire roughly 10-15 minutes after completion of the game. See below for a link to the questionnaire:

The intent of this questionnaire was to uncover any core gameplay issues that users felt detracted from the quality of the game, and also prompted for any new features the user would like to see.
