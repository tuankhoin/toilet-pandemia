## Game Explanation and Gameplay
**Game Explanation**

Our game is a first person shooter (FPS), based in a post-apocalyptic world where COVID-19 has ravaged the world's population. You assume the role of an average citizen, intent on locating and distributing the vaccine to finally put an end to the pandemic. However this vaccine is held in a nearby shopping center, defended by a horde of Karens who want nothing more than to see the world burn, having succumbed to the frustrations of state-enforced lockdown long ago. 

Your objective, to enter the shopping center, and collect critical supplies for the residents in your community, all the while doing the following:

1. Avoiding incineration at the hands of the Karens' powerful fire attacks
2. Maintaining an appropriate 1.5m social distance, or else risk contracting COVID-19 from the Karens themselves
3. Surviving long enough to discover the super vaccine, and taking it when it appears

Points are accrued for gathering supplies, defeating Karens, and surviving levels. Health packs will also randomly spawn, that will allow the player to recover any lost health. The game takes on a classic arcade 'survival' format, that is, the player plays until he/she finally falls to the Karen hordes, an inevitability since each level rises in difficulty to eventually impossible scenarios.
